# 1.1
# The efficiency of bonk is logarithmic
# The return and total are constant
# The while loop only takes an extra step every 2n - it doesn't look at every item





# 1.2
# The efficiency of is_prime is linear
# This is because it looks at every value up to n





# 1.3 
# The efficiency of mod_7 is linear
